* git clone git@github.com:SunKing2/Scramblelovers-Word-Games.git
* cd 'Scramblelovers Word Games/scramble'
* install maven
* mvn package
* ...
* Then do choose either Java or node, and do one of the following:
* hop to node directory
* node webserver.js
* http://localhost:8080
* or
* with java
* (I'm using Glassfish as a server, you can probably get away with Tomcat for awhile)
* copy the war to your server and hop to 
http://localhost:8080/scramble

Please look in the design directory to see what we are working on.  Minimally, we'll create a new document in there each day.
